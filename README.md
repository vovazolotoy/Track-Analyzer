## Export data from "My Tracks" to JSON
[My Tracks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyTracks) GPS tracking application use [Keyhole Markup Language (KML) ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KML) files for store geo data. For export this geo data to json format was created **kml2json** cli application.
```
 Usage: kml2json [options]

 Options:

 -h, --help           output usage information
 -V, --version        output the version number
 -i, --input [file]   input kml file
 -o, --output [file]  output json file
```
```
$ kml2json -i tracks/2.kml -o tracks/2.json
Done â€“ 442 records exported.
```
Example of record (time is in microseconds)
```
    {
        "time": 1408215039029,
        "speed": 4.952657,
        "acceleration": 0.10101690870522967,
        "latitude": -115.17242,
        "longitude": 36.057326,
        "elevation": 676.5
    }
```

## Import data into MongoDB
JSON data returned from **kml2json** can be imported with **mongoimport**
```
$ mongoimport --db geo --collection tracks < tracks/2.json --jsonArray
```
```

## MongoDB MapReduce Data Analyzing

Have you ever wondered how your driver is representing your company with his driving style?
GPS Tracking technology can give you the ability to monitor driver behaviour better than ever before.

This toolkit is example of MapReduce data analyzing for finding in GPS tracks points with harsh braking and rapid acceleration
